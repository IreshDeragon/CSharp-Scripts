# CSharp-Scripts
A small collection of the scripts I developed in C#

For work I had to develop a script to delete some phone records older than 6 months on a server. Here, since the file are grouped by Year\mounth\day etc... I delete by month thanks to the repository and not thanks to the metadata.


Please note that the script may not work on a different file disposition since it was never meant to.
