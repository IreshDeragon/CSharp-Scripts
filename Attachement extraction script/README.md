# CSharp-Scripts
A small collection of the scripts I developed in C#

Here is a C# script to extract attachments from mails having a certain type of object, via the protocol Imap.

It uses the library MailKit which work quite well. You can find the library on GitHub by going on the following link:
https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit



note that I didn't do any exception treatment or login information securing, so there's still improvement to be done.
